## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Neovim `>= 0.10.0`
- [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as your plugin manager.

### Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
        "atiladefreitas/lazyclip",
        config = function()
            require("lazyclip").setup({
                -- your custom config here (optional)
            })
        end,
        keys = {
            { "Cw", desc = "Open Clipboard Manager" },
        },
        -- Optional: Load plugin when yanking text
        event = { "TextYankPost" },
}
```

Run the following commands in Neovim to install LazyClip:

```vim
:Lazy sync
```

### Default Configuration

LazyClip comes with sensible defaults that you can override:

```lua
{
    -- Core settings
    max_history = 100,      -- Maximum number of items to keep in history
    items_per_page = 9,     -- Number of items to show per page
    min_chars = 5,          -- Minimum characters required to store item
    
    -- Window appearance
    window = {
        relative = "editor",
        width = 70,         -- Width of the floating window
        height = 12,        -- Height of the floating window
        border = "rounded", -- Border style
    },
    
    -- Internal keymaps for the lazyclip window
    keymaps = {
        close_window = "q",      -- Close the clipboard window
        prev_page = "h",         -- Go to previous page
        next_page = "l",         -- Go to next page
        paste_selected = "", -- Paste the selected item
        move_up = "k",           -- Move selection up
        move_down = "j",         -- Move selection down
        delete_item = "d"        -- Delete selected item
    }
}
```

## 🛠️ Usage
